Requirement: 
1: Python2(minor changes needed for python3)
2: Matlab 2018a or higher

The project is the code for INFOCOM2020 paper:Flow Table Security in SDN: Adversarial Reconnaissance and Intelligent Attacks.

To use the program, first you need to download and unzip the trace file (UNIV1 or UNIV2) http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~tbenson/IMC10_Data.html.
(For UNIV2 you need to truncate it first, my desktop breaks down when I run the readcap() function :<)

Then you can finish the trace preprocess. In the directory, use tracereader.py to extrace key information and use zipfit.py to estimate the 
alpha parameter. Then you can use hard.py to obtain samples with short time periods to run experiments. Since json cant be used for
maltab program, directransfer.py can help translate json to mat data file.

As the codes in infer_attack, go to check to Readme.txt inside the directory. The codes correspond to all the figures and experiments in the paper.

Welcome for any suggestions!

To use the code, please site the paper.
